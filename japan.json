My every interaction with people here isn't sleazy used care salesman type, but it just feels like they're not trying very hard to even reach bare minimum. That and the relentless pollution with all the burning and whatnot. What was air quality like in central VN? I live in Chiang Mai where it's exceptionally bad this time of year. I've been to Udon Thani twice and found it to be a braindead town full of rubber-tapping alcoholics who couldn't tie their shoelaces but were very capable of wailing out 2AM renditions of \"my buffalo died, my wife ran away\". Wasn't there a story like 2 years ago about a gang of Udon youths who dug up a fresh mass grave of dogs so they could eat them, only to end up in the hospital getting rabies jabs because the dogs were rabid mutts who were put down by the local government and just dumped in a random field? Feels to me like Thailand combines the worst bits of rapidly advancing modernity together with the worst bits of leftover stone-age moronic values and ideas. At least in places like Laos you've still got the novelty of being in the thick of the jungle and although there may be dickheads at least unlike Thais they're too poor to translate their stupidity into widespread damage by fast cars on long stretches of road, getting tanked up on booze/meth, shallow nationalistic sentiments, fragile male egoes, food loaded with pesticides, lazy wasteful burning of carcinogenic plastic garbage, etc etc. Is Vietnam the same?

I mean, it's not like you can say \"oh, I'm from London\" and then give them a Russian passport and get a teaching visa.There are still illegal jobs around but they're trending downwards and they've become a lot harder to find and even harder to keep in the tier 1 cities. Out in the sticks it can still work though.Beijing has really purged the illegal schools, Shenzhen and Shanghai have crackdowns semi-regularly but maybe the turnover and general mass of illegal teachers means it will take a while.The only school I know that makes a big habit of employing illegal teachers is associated with a university and employs teachers on student visas, I guess that's safe enough. The ones that do tourist and business visas are amateurs at it and will probably get purged some time because they don't have an officially approved rort or friends in immigration who can ok their fraud."},

He was outspoken and brash and openly critical of Vietnam's government. His speeches are a big hit on YouTube. He built all those beautiful bridges and hospitals and all of that. It is a sparking-ly clean, modern city, and it's near Hoi An and many many local hidden waterfalls and beaches and so on. Hoi An of course, is magical. Expats from all over the world have flocked here, and it's wonderful to have that diversity. And Vietnamese food in Vietnam in general, is not as good as Vietnamese food overseas, like in the US. Competition is good, it breeds innovation and improvement. Kaizen. I hate Saigon. Hopefully one day they'll have public transport like Japan and things will improve. Da Lat is great to go in the summer to escape the heat, because it's in the mountains so it's cool year-round. Breathtaking. Flowers and the lake and waterfalls and so on.
